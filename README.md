# BrailleTutor
Open Sourced Code for BrailleTutor App formerly on the App Store.

BrailleTutor / BrailleBuddy (other name) is an app designed to teach the Braille alphabet in an elegant and accessibly-designed memory-style game. It functions as a roulette of randomly selected letters with resuable UI Components to match, entirely written in SwiftUI. You are free to borrow from the code and/or image and sound assets as I have no licensing restrictions on these items. However, credit (even in comments) would be nice where possible ðŸ˜€.  


Accessiblity features include differentiating without color (i.e., a symbol that highlights the selected "bubble" instead of only color), screen reader, and haptic feedback. Additionally, you can toggle in-game sounds. 

Below are some images of my redesign of an unpublished update before I decided to open source it. Enjoy!
